  <h1>The Bidet's Revivals</h1>

    It’s been completely Americanized!”</a> my host declares proudly.
    “The bidet is gone!” In my time as a travel editor, this scenario has become common when touring improvements
   to hotels and resorts around the world. My heart sinks when I hear it. To me, this doesn’t feel like progress, but prejudice.
   Americans seem especially baffled by these basins. Even seasoned American travelers are unsure of their purpose: <strong>One globe-trotter asked me,</strong>
 “Why do the bathrooms in this hotel have both toilets and urinals?” And even if they understand the bidet’s function,
 Americans often fail to see its appeal. Attempts to popularize the bidet in the United States have failed before,
 but recent efforts continue—and perhaps they might even succeed in bringing this Old World device to new backsides.
