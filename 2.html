<p>The name is rooted in the French word for “pony,” which offers a helpful hint that the basin should be straddled.
  But it also picked up this moniker because royalty used it to clean up after a ride. Hauling water was a laborious process
   in that era, but bidet bathing was a regular indulgence for the aristocracy and upper classes. This little bathing workhorse
    was so much a part of high society that the artist Louis-Léopold Boilly, who painted French middle- and upper-class life,
     showcased a young woman with her skirts hiked over the washbasin in one of his works—providing a racy bidet counterpart
      to Degas’s bathtub portraits. They were such an integral part of civilized life that even the imprisoned Marie Antoinette
       was granted a red-trimmed one while awaiting the guillotine. She may have been in a dank, rat-infested cell, but her right
        to freshen up would not be denied.</p>
