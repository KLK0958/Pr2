<p>Versions in the 1700s sometimes featured a water-pump handle that could deliver an upward spray from a refillable tank.
   As indoor plumbing caught on in the 1800s, the bidet moved from the bedroom into the bathroom,
   and the standard model came into use: a tiny tub that could be filled with a faucet at either end.
   The first of the plumbed bidets were most common in high society, but its popularity soon spread, 
   both to other social classes in France and to other countries in Western Europeâ€”as well as Latin America,
   the Middle East, and Asia.</p>
