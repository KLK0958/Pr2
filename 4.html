  <p>Throughout this bidet boom, the United States resisted its appeal, and the reason might have been the power of first impressions.
     Americans were introduced to bidets on a broad scale during World War II, when troops were stationed in Europe.
     GIs visiting bordellos would often see bidets in the bathrooms, so they began to associate these basins with sex work.
      Given Americaâ€™s puritanical past, it makes sense that, once back home, servicemen would feel squeamish presenting
      these fixtures to their homeland.</p>
