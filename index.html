<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>In 1964, the American Bidet Company took another run at making the bidet more palatable by combining the toilet seat with a
  spritzing function. The company’s founder, Arnold Cohen, created this device for his ailing father; studies have shown that
  bidet bathing can help heal rashes, hemorrhoids, and other irritations. But Cohen also saw his mission as “changing the habits
   of a nation, weaning us off the Charmin.” Unfortunately, Cohen, a former ad man, struggled to broadcast his message for what
   he called the Sitzbath. “I installed thousands of my seats all over the suburbs of New York ... but advertising was
   a next-to-impossible challenge,” he said. “Nobody wants to hear about Tushy Washing 101.”

While America was deaf to Cohen’s message, another nation was listening: Japan. That same year, Cohen met with representatives
of a Japanese trading company, Nichimen Jitsugyo. The firm eventually worked up its own design, which was modeled after the Sitzbath.
 By 1980 another Japanese company, Toto, would pioneer the “washlet,” a multifunction, control-panel-driven bidet-toilet hybrid
 that was enthusiastically adopted by Japanese households. As Toto’s general manager of restroom product research put it,
  “We did what others were reluctant to try—we brought electronics into the water closet.”</p>
<h3>Qusetion</h3>
  <p>The United States has largely ignored the bidet and its spin-offs, but it has warmly welcomed an alternative
    product: flushable wet wipes. These wipes became a cheapie work-around to address many of the same issues as the bidet,
    but they come at a much higher cost to the public.
